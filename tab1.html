<div class="editor">WebGL, developed by the not-for-profit KhronosGroup [2], is a relatively new technology that began its development around 2006 and released version 1.0 in 2011.WebGL looks similar to existing technologies from the viewpoint of displaying 3D objects inside web browsers, but it is technologically different from previous technologies such as VRML because WebGL is a cross-platform JavaScript API based on OpenGL ES 2.0 and exposed through the HTML5 canvas element.</div>
